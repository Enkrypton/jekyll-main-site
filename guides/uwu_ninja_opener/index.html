<p>This opener does 12-15k DPS with random level 80 gear which is a bit more than my Samurai which has a valid BiS for this fight. So I’m pretty sure that
this opener is fairly optimal and valid.</p>

<p>Here is the opener shown below, which goes up to when the Plumes die and Garuda screeches and goes untargetable:</p>

<p><img src="/main/assets/nin_uwu_opener.png" alt="Ninja Opener for Ultima Weapon Ultimate" /></p>

<h4>Written Instructions </h4>

<p>10 Seconds Pre-pull: Huton and Doton</p>

<p>5 Seconds Pre-pull: Ten Chi</p>

<p>On pull: Mudra (Ration)</p>

<p>Move towards Garuda, SE,GS, then Set-up trick with TCJ.</p>

<p>Trick immediately after TCJ and Shadow Fang right after Trick. You will have 1.0 seconds to weave Trick due to TCJ so be fast and don’t clip Shadow Fang.</p>

<p>Weave DWAD after Shadow Fang then Raiton, Kassastu and Raiton again. FInish with Assassinate.<br />
You will have 1.0 seconds to weave Kassastu due to Ninjitsu, so be fast and don’t clip the second Raiton. Don’t spam your Mudra key since you might bunny.
Hit Ten/Jin once after Kassastu and the game’s skill queue will take over. Press Chi after Ten/Jin has been pressed by skill queue.</p>

<p>Finish the 1, 2, 3 now with AE and weave a Mug. Then do your 1, 2, 3 again. (SE, GS, AE). Trick will end here.</p>

<p>Plumes will appear and converge on the party right as you finish hitting AE so weave a Hellfrog Medium after AE.</p>

<p>Use Katon as your next GCD and do your Death Blossom -&gt; Hakke Mujinsatsu if the adds are still not dead. Garuda will screech and go untargetable.</p>

<h4>FAQ</h4>

<p><strong>Q: Why is there no Doton during Plumes?</strong><br />
A: You might kill the Spiny Plume with the Doton and you will make your Tank’s life harder if they try to avoid it.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why don’t you Kassastu your Katon during Plumes instead?</strong><br />
A: You would want to skip Garuda’s last mechanics so it is better to do as much to Garuda in the opener. In addition to this it might be overkill on the adds since 
your party is also hitting down these adds here. Doing Kassastu ealier on also loops better for future burst phases.<br />
You <em>can</em> skip the Kassastu in Ration and use Kassastu on Katon here since it is a potency gain if you really want to pad your parse, but inform your
party to tone down the AOEs since a 650 potency AoE hits really hard and you might kill the Spiny Plume.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Raiton on pull, not Suiton? Setting up Trick with TCJ?</strong><br />
A: Mathematical calculations to explain below:</p>

<p>Raiton on pull is a 200 potency gain if used instead of Suiton.<br />
TCJ total potency is 500 + 800 + 600 = 1900, so inside Trick, TCJ will do 5% more damage which is<br />
1900 * 0.05 = 95 potency.</p>

<p>If you Suiton on pull you lose 200 potency but gain 95 potency from TCJ inside Trick.<br />
If you Raiton on pull you gain 200 potency but lose 95 potency from TCJ outside of Trick.</p>

<p>It is a 105 potency gain to pull with Raiton and set up Trick with TCJ.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Wait, really? How come the 80 opener uses TCJ inside Trick?</strong><br />
A: Since you have Meisui at level 80 and you don’t at level 70. In the opener you will Meisui the Suiton you get from TCJ and get to use a “free” Bhavacakra which is 300 potency.<br />
This 300 potency makes up for the 105 potency loss from the previous question and turns it into a potency gain.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you like Math?</strong><br />
A: Yeah.</p>

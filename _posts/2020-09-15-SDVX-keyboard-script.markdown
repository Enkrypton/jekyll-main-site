Created sometime in 2017 to play Sound Voltex with a keyboard since I didn't own a controller at that time. The code was then optimized, linted and documented by my freind Superoswald to create the final v2 script. 

The script is fully doucmented with a quick setup guide all within the python file. 

There are better Sound Voltex keyboard tools/scripts now in 2020. But this script serves as a memoriam to the earlier days enjoying of bemani games at home with my friend, Superoswald.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

![Me as a Samurai, who also mastered gpose along with the blade](/main/assets/samurai_guide/samurai_image.png)

This is meant to be a detailed and in-depth guide of Samurai as a job it self while still remaining very simple to understand guide for people who just
wish to know how to play the job well.

All of the subsections that includes an rotational image are the only sections you need to read if you just want to know how to play Samurai. All the other
subsections are an detailed explanation of how and why everything works. This is for readers who want to understand Samurai as a job on a better level and become
an overall better Samurai player.

<h3> The Opener </h3>

We start off with the standard opener, knowing to do this correctly sets you up for everything else.  
I will later go over in more detail about every individual weaponskill and ability to explain why this opener "works".

This is also the standard Higanbana First opener. More detail about the alternative "Midare First" aka the 9th GCD Tsubame opener will be explained below.

<h2> Samurai In-depth </h2>

<h3>The Samurai 123</h3>
<h4>Hakaze, Shifu, Jinpu, Yukikaze, Gekko, Kasha </h4>

![The Samurai 123](/main/assets/samurai_guide/123.png)

Unlike most Jobs, Samurai does not have a basic 1, 2, 3 combo. Instead it uses 3 basic combos that are two, three, and three GCDs in length. 

![Samurai Basic Combos](/main/assets/samurai_guide/combos.png)

Each of these three combos have their unique properties which is worth knowing about.

<h4>Yukikaze Combo</h4>

This is the two GCD combo that has no positional requirement.

Upon finishing the combo the total potency dealt would be:

200 (Hakaze) + 360 (Yukikaze) = 560 Potency

You will also gain the "Setsu" sen upon hitting Yukikaze. The Yukikaze Combo is also the quickest way to gain 1 sen, being a two GCD combo.

Upon hitting Hakaze you will gain 5 Kenki.  
Upon hitting Yukikaze you will gain 15 Kenki.
It is good to note here that Yukikaze is the weaponskill that gains the most Kenki.

<h4>Gekko Combo</h4>

This a three GCD combo that has the rear positional on hitting Gekko.

Upon finishing the combo the total potency dealt would be:

200 (Hakaze) + 320 (Jinpu) + 480 (Gekko) = 1000 Potency

You will gain the Jinpu buff upon hitting Jinpu. This your very important 40 second 13% damage-up buff that should be always up.

You will also gain the "Getsu" sen upon hitting Gekko.

Upon hitting Hakaze you will gain 5 Kenki.  
Upon hitting Jinpu you will gain 5 Kenki.
Upon hitting Gekko you will gain 10 Kenki if the positional requirement is meet. Otherwise, you gain 5.

<h4>Kasha Combo</h4>

This a three GCD combo that has the flank positional on hitting Kasha.

Upon finishing the combo the total potency dealt would be:

200 (Hakaze) + 320 (Shifu) + 480 (Kasha) = 1000 Potency

You will gain the Shifu buff upon hitting Shifu. This your very important 40 second 13% skill speed buff that needs to be always up for proper rotation looping.

You will also gain the "Ka" sen upon hitting Kasha.

Upon hitting Hakaze you will gain 5 Kenki.  
Upon hitting Shifu you will gain 5 Kenki.
Upon hitting Kasha you will gain 10 Kenki if the positional requirement is meet. Otherwise, you gain 5.

<h3>Disengage Combo</h3>
<h4>Keep uptime as a melee</h4>

This combo serves as a way to avoid point blank AoEs or get into a position within 10 yalms while still keeping the GCDs rolling.

**Hissatsu: Yaten**, or just Yaten is a 100 potency move that also backsteps your character 10 yalms behind the direction they were looking at.  
It works the same way as a Dragoon's Elusive Jump but this does damage, requires a target and is only 10 yalms instead of 15.

Yaten also has the following properties:

Gain 10 Kenki upon usage.  
Enpi changes to Enhanced Enpi dealing 320 potency instead of 100 potency.

**Enpi** is Samurai's 15 yalm ranged attack that does 100 potency by default. It also increases Kenki by 10 on usage.  
Use Enpi only when know you will not be in melee range in the next 2-3 seconds.  
Using Enhanced Enpi is neither a potency gain nor loss when you are not in the middle of any combos.  
You will "lose" a GCD for 320 potency, but the average potency per GCD on Samurai is 320.  
Never use Enpi where it will break your combo. Enpi breaks your combo upon usage.

**Hissatsu: Gyoten**, or just Gyoten is your generic 20 yalm gap closer however it is a DPS LOSS to use it.  
Shinten costs 25 Kenki for a 320 potency hit while Gyoten is 10 Kenki for a 100 potency hit.

It is only worth to use Gyoten when you are going to lose a GCD running towards the target. If you can run back to the target without losing a GCD,
do not use Gyoten. If you used Yaten-Enpi to disengage and do not need to move afterwards, you will have enough time to run 15 yalms back to target during the cooldown of Enpi
and will not need to use Gyoten. Gyoten should only be used at around 17-20 yalms.  
You also gain 20 Kenki from Yaten-Enpi if Gyoten is not used.

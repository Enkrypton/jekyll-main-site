Low rDPS but still top aDPS
<!--more-->

This is a WIP guide I will update as I progress through UWU.

I am currently on Titan Gaols dealing a consistent 8k aDPS.
This guide is MAINLY meant to teach samurai players how to pad their parse and optimize their uptime.  
I recommend the reader to have a basic idea of how to do this raid before reading on but this guide still goes over EXACTLY what you need to do as a melee player.

<h3> Budget BiS </h3>
The best budget BiS is the 2.00 GCD BiS for this current raid tier. (5.2) If you got BiS for this raid tier, all you need to do is remeld and get the A.Crystarium Body
piece if you don't have it.  
Since Samurai GCD speed is very important dealing with the timeline of the raid. This is the BiS I will be making this guide in. This means my timeline and timings will be
based off the 2.00 SYNC GCD in this raid which is 2.11. If you already have this BiS you can skip to Garuda since I just explain why 2.00 GCD is the preferred BiS.
![The 2.00 GCD Best in Slot for Samurai. Also known as the Fast Sam](/main/assets/sam_uwu_bis.png)
There exists a slightly better 1.92 BiS that requires you to farm Stormblood Dungeons but the quickest and best BiS to get with minimal farm is the current 2.00 GCD BiS. Fast Samurai
in UWU especially with sync is very much better than slow samurai since crits can very much mess you up during some mechanics, namely Garuda Plumes and Ifrit nails... and yes
when I did this fight as slow sam on the 2.14 GCD BiS I have crit my midare on an Ifrit nail which blew up instantly as well as completely nuking the Spiny Plume with Hissastu: Guren.  
So I say your best bet is fast sam with the 2.00 GCD is you are too lazy to farm. It does more DPS overall than slow sam on sync as well. 

<h3> Garuda </h3>
This is probably the easist place to pad.

Sprint when you see the countdown change from 2 to 1. Then make sure you hit the boss as early as possible without early pulling.
Depending on how your group does it, move to opposite of the OT to avoid the line attack and dodge the green tornado AoE afterwards. This is during your opener which is
the EXACT same as the level 80 opener but you must save your Hissatsu: Guren here. This is your AoE line attack that does 850 potency with a 120 second cooldown which also costs
50 kenki. You lose your Hissatsu: Senei at level 70 but in both Garuda and Ifrit using Hissatsu: Guren is better so its not really a big deal. 

You will finish your opener and at this time the plumes will spawn and move right as you hit your Gekko. As the plumes move towards the party you will be in your GCD so start
mashing your Fuga right away while moving slightly more behind the party. You will have 90 Kenki at this point since you saved your Hissatsu: Guren. It will be tempting to use
Shinten but don't. You will hit most or all of the plumes if you moved slightly behind the party and cause Fuga's range is longer than its animation. Now hit your Oka to gain 
your second sen. You may want to move a little further back until you can make sure there are no plumes behind your hitbox. Now hit Kaiten and your Iaijistu button to do Tenka
Goken. During the cast time start mashing Hissatsu: Guren. If all goes right you will straight up nuke all the plumes. Take a look at your parse overlay you should be at around
10-14k dps if you hit all the adds. Hit a Hakaze on Garuda and then mash Jinpu and hope you didnt delay any GCDs. If it doesn't hit then target the Spiny Plume and hit it with a Jinpu,
Right as the Jinpu hits, Garuda will screech and go untargetable. Move for the feather rain. You may need to inform your tank that you will be using a GCD on the spiny since
it does do a significant amount of damage.

The opener up to this point looks like this:

![Ultima Weapon Ultimate Samurai Opener](/main/assets/uwu_opener.png)

Garuda comes back. Position yourself north with the tank. Finish with Gekko to end the combo. Weave third eye after the Gekko for the Mistral Song then move into where ever the bubble was dropped by the Spiny Plume 
and carry on with your rotation. (Hakaze, Yukikaze) but weave your Hissatsu: Seigan somewhere in between. Move out of the bubble when you see the start of the Friction cast and
group with the 3 people assigned to be outside of the bubble. Weave a Bloodbath around this time to help your healers. You should be doing your 2 GCD filler right before the second DPS moves in.

Mechanics wise, move in and out of the bubble on your assigned order. If you are first to enter, move 1 GCD after Friction applies its damage or when you see everyone is around 75% health.
If you are second DPS to enter, watch the first DPS to enter, then move in immediately after you see everyone is 75% health. Our group has one of the healers saying "go" whenever he
has healed everyone up. 

Now in terms of optimizing, you do not need to use True North here since the boss should be facing towards the 5 people inside the bubble, so if you are standing at the side
waiting to go in, you will be naturally at the flank during your Kasha Combo. You should have just pressed Hakaze and Kaiten and be ready to Higanbana after the third DPS has
resolved the bubble mechanic. Do your Higanbana and mash Yukikaze. If you hit Jinpu before in the first screech, you should hit this as well. Garuda will screech and go untargetable just as you hit your Yukikaze.
Dodge the feather rain but press Meikyo Shisui while moving back. When Garuda is targetable again hit your Gekko and Kasha. Use Kaiten and Midare and finish with Gekko. Continue your
rotation as normal. Garuda will screech again but remain targetable. You should hit your Yukikaze at this time and be ready to Midare after the screech. Make sure you move and don't
get hit by the tank's feather rain. Press Kaiten while moving, don't delay Midare and hit it after you dodged the feather rain. The GCDs should align perfectly. Hit a Hakaze Yukikaze and 
move towards the middle to resolve the markers mechanics. Press Third Eye while moving back to the middle. 

Skills and timing should look like this unless you were late on hitting the boss during countdown:

![Ultima Weapon Ultimate Samurai Rotation Part1](/main/assets/uwu_rotation_p1.png)

While stacking, use your Enpi once. Your Jinpu buff will fall off at this time but its no issue. When Garuda screeches again, press your Gyoten (dash to target) right
when you hear the screech. This is a bit risky if your tank baits their feather rain on the boss. Running back is an option too theres not that much of a difference.
Immediately hit your Gekko combo to get your Jinpu back and be prepared to make adjustments to avoid the Tornado AoEs. Save your Kenki at this time.

Plumes will spawn soon. While moving back to the center with the tank you should be just hitting 3 sen. Midare the boss. The moment you finish Midare the plumes will be in range for
for your Hissastu: Kyuten. So weave that out of your Midare cast. Target an add and do both the AoE combos in any order, weaving a Kyuten between each GCD. The adds should die pretty
fast. Garuda will screech but remain targetable, you should be finishing your last AoE combo at this time. Hit a Hakaze on Garuda while dodging the feather rain.
The best way to do this is to dodge with the tank. Finish with Yukikaze and then Midare. Garuda should be basically dead at this point but if not Do any 3 GCD combo and Hagakure it immediately.
Garuda should really be dead after doing the 3 GCD combo. If your group is low on DPS and you see Wicked Wheel, then don't Hagakure and hope you can do another Midare before the boss dies.

Meikyo Shisui, Ikishoten and Hissastu: Guren will be ready at this point but hold them for Ifrit. You want to skip the tankbusters near the end of Ifrit so you want to output max
damage to Ifrit. Our party pots on our Ifrit re-openers so I always save those 3 abilities for Ifrit. Garuda becomes a training dummy at this point so just do your rotation,
kill Garuda, and go next phase. If you and your party are doing good you will always almost skip the Wicked Wheel which is just a telegraphed point blank and an "get near the boss" mechanic. 

<h3> Transition Phase 1 </h3>
Healer will get the Beyond Limits, so don't accidentally take it. If you have any sen, you want to Hagakure it right away, you want to do a clean re-opener to align with buffs and your pot.
Move to the center of the stage and press the following abilities in order:  
Hagakure -> Sprint -> Meditate

The way I do this mechanic is I rotate my camera around to find Ifrit. Then I move my camera either left or right and look closely. The second I see a small blob of fire appear
the side I am looking at, I 180 my camera and hold W until I am at the safe spot which is opposite of the side I was looking at. If I do not see a blob of fire, I just hold W 
and run into the safe spot that appeared where I was looking at. If you are Dragoon just backflip there, it places you right at the safe spot. Ninjas can also directly TP to the safe spot.

<h3> Ifrit </h3>

coming soon 

notes: pot on re-opener. hit positional manually. Guren the 2 nails and ifrit.

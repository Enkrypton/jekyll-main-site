<h3> Budget BiS </h3>
The best budget BiS is the 2.00 GCD BiS for this current raid tier. (5.2)  
If you got BiS for this raid tier, all you need to do is remeld and get the A.Crystarium Body piece if you don't have it.  
![The 2.00 GCD Best in Slot for Samurai. Also known as the Fast Sam](/main/assets/samurai_uwu/sam_uwu_bis.png)

Theres a better BiS for this fight that requires you to farm Stormblood dungeons, you can view it [here](https://bit.ly/Community-BIS).
<h3> Garuda </h3>

![Ultima Weapon Ultimate Samurai Opener](/main/assets/samurai_uwu/uwu_opener.png)

Depending on your skill speed you may not be able to fit in Hakaze or Jinpu. Either way, continue your rotation on as normal after the untargetable phase


*  Make sure to use Ikishoten as soon as possible without overcapping in this phase
*  You can Third Eye the first Mistral Shriek once Garuda comes back, use it at around 25% of the cast bar 
*  Dodge feather rain to the North and stay North since Garuda will reappear facing South and does no cleaves at this time
*  You can Third Eye the SECOND friction if you did the above. Use this right when you see the cast or even before since Friction casts very fast
*  You can pop Bloodbath right as the Bubble appears to help out healers
*  The best way to figure out when to enter the bubble (regardless of order) is to just make sure the party is higher than 80% health including shields
*  You can Third Eye the Mistral Shriek that happens right after the Feather Rain, popping it 1 GCD after Garuda is targetable
*  Stay up from with the Tank after the above Mistral Shriek since Garuda will be facing South and does no cleaves, this also makes it easier to move with the tank
*  You can Third Eye the targeted line AoEs at around 80% of the Wicked Wheel cast
*  Keep an eye on your tanks and reengage away from where they come from to avoid their feather rains
*  Start to save Kenki at this point to spend it on Kyuten during plumes
*  Use Ikishoten as soon as it is available after the Kyuten spam so it will come off cooldown during nails in Ifrit
*  Do not use Meikyo when it comes off cooldown at this time, safe it for the re-opener in Ifrit
*  Don't waste Kenki if Garuda is at 0.1% HP and casting, get some extra Sen or refresh your buffs
*  You can meditate 10-20 Kenki while waiting for the Ifrit dash safe spot
*  Hagakure any Sen, most groups use 2 miniute buffs and pots on Ifrit so a clean re-opener would be ideal

<h3> Ifrit </h3>

![Reopener for Ifrit](/main/assets/samurai_uwu/uwu_ifrit_reopener.png)

You will enter Ifrit with a large amount of Kenki. Shinten shown in opener is recommended placement for usage if you are about to overcap.  
The opener is Jinpu first due to Shinten usage and the player may have Shifu and Jinpu still active at this time.

*  Third Eye as shown in the opener, you have 1 GCD worth of time to Third Eye the Hellfire
*  Most groups Pot on this phase to skip additional Tank Busters at the end, so as you would normally pot in the opener
*  You will be weaving every GCD at the start of this opener so save your Seigan and don't double weave on accident
*  Use Shinten at shown placements in the opener if you are going to overcap
*  Arms length is group dependent, most groups shield but the placement shown in the opener works well timing and weaving wise
*  If you Ikishoten immediately off cooldown in Garuda it will be up right as nails spawn, use this immediately as well without over capping 
*  Use the Kenki either gained from Ikitshoten (or saved up) to Guren the two front nails and Ifrit, the tanks need to pull Ifrit in-between the nails and you need to place
yourself to the left or right of the nails like so, and target the nail:
![Place to stand to hit both nails and Ifrit](/main/assets/samurai_uwu/ifrit_placement.png)
*  Depending on the group you can also place yourself in the middle of Ifrit's hitbox, while targeting Ifrit and do your AoE combo and weave Kyuten in-between to hit both nails and Ifrit
*  When the first nail grows big, wait one GCD and press your Third Eye to get a Seigan proc. You may want to plan with your group to consistently get this off.
*  When Ifrit jumps and comes back, Third Eye again after one GCD for the Hellfire, it will be up before then
*  You can hit positionals up until you see the ranged Eruption baiters join up with the group, hit flanks AWAY from the Searing Healer
*  You may want to start saving True North stacks for Titan at around here
*  You can hit a Feint around here to help out Tanks/Healers
*  You can consistently Third Eye the Flaming Crush 2 GCDs after seeing the marker appear 
*  During Ifrit dash phase, you can Meditate for 10-30 Kenki depending on shifting over one spot or not, make sure to Sprint out of Meditate if it is a two spot movement
*  Keep hitting Ifrit for extra resources until it dies, do not spend Kenki unless overcapping. You also want to prioritize refreshing buffs (Jinpu > Shifu)
*  Third eye 2-3 seconds after Ifrit dies to proc your Seigan from Titan's Geocrush, make sure you are at the wall

<h3> Titan </h3>

Foreword: Things here get a bit inconsistent due to Ifrit killing times. Things like Tank Tethers, Eruption baiters and random Crits on nails can make Ifrit killing times very inconsistent.

Your opener here depends on the amount of Sen you have right before killing Ifrit:  
If you have 1 or 2 Sen, press Hagakure and do REOPENER 2  
If you have 3 Sen, do REOPENER 1  
If you have 3 Sen less than 10 Kenki, you messed up. Press Hagakure and do REOPENER 2  

<h4> REOPENER 1 </h4>

![Titan re-opener1](/main/assets/samurai_uwu/uwu_titan_reopener1.png)

You will have approximately 8 GCDs before the plumes first appear, so you can replace the last Hakaze > Jinpu with Kaiten > Higanbana if you are able to slidecast it moving back from second plumes

<h4> REOPENER 2 </h4>

![Titan re-opener1](/main/assets/samurai_uwu/uwu_titan_reopener2.png)

You will have approximately 8 GCDs before the plumes first appear, you may have to slidecast your Higanbana

<h4> After first jump </h4>

*  Find the safe wall and hit Third Eye. The timing is around 4-5 seconds after seeing Titan jump
*  Move up to Titan and hit Guren while moving there, it should be up
*  Finish your combo and/or refresh your lowest buff while weaving your Seigan somewhere in-between
*  After knockbacks I personally find it easier to use your Gap Closer then move out of landslides so they are baited down the middle 
*  If you are getting jailed, as a Melee you should be at the top of the jails priority list, so if you used your Gap Closer you can dodge landslides and easily move in to place
*  If you are second jail (due to another melee higher on the priority for jails) then do not gap close and move into place 
*  Use True North after jails since Titan will be on the wall
*  You can Third Eye the Tumults here
*  Save Meikyo Shisui when it comes off cooldown here since Titan will do Awoken Landslides and Geocrush shortly after the plumes
*  You will still be wanting to use Ikishoten off cooldown without overcapping
*  Awoken Landslide safe spot is to move into the first non-diagonal landslides at max-melee range as close to the middle of the landslide as possible

![Awoken Landslide Safespot](/main/assets/samurai_uwu/titan_safespot.png)

*  You can Third Eye the Second Geocrush with similar 4-5 second timing after the jump
*  Do your rotation as per normal here as if you have your burst, use Meikyo Shisui and so forth
*  Hit the Healer jail with Midare if it will not cost you a GCD, otherwise use it on Titan then focus the Healer jail
*  Use Feint after the 4th or 5th Tumult here if your Tank is not using invuln, these tank busters are physical damage and you can help out by using Feint
*  After seeing the "table-flipper" tank buster you can run up with your tanks if your group does Mario Kart strat for uptime, make sure to use Sprint to make things easier
*  Third Eye any Tumults that happen for free Seigan procs
*  You can delay Iaijitsus during plumes if you are unsure about slidecasting, the safest time to Iaijitsu is right when the plumes spawn
*  Guren comes back around here, I recommend saving it for Ultima unless your group really needs to push Titan to avoid the last Tankbusters
*  You can Third Eye Magitek Bits' initial hit as well, the timing is 5-6 seconds after seeing the AoE marker

<h3> Final Transition </h3>

*  Hit Magitek Bits for Kenki and Sen, you should be able to fit in 3 GCDs, Prioritize getting the Ka Sen
*  Use Merciful Eyes if you want, don't waste a 15 Kenki Seigan on the bits. The Third Eye proc won't last to Ultima
*  If you are the Melee LB you can hit 3 GCDs before having to LB. If you don't have Setsu Sen, hit Hakaze, Yukikaze, Hakaze and LB immediately. 
*  If you are not the Melee LB you can get your missing 2 sen just by keep hitting Lahabrea
*  You can meditate the full duration after the LB
*  Idealistically you should be 100 Kenki with 3 Sen
*  At minimum you should be 2 Sen (Setsu and Ka) and over 50 Kenki

<h3> The Ultima Weapon </h3>

Reopening for Ultima is somewhat inconsistent but you should be at 2 Sen (Setsu and Ka) or 3 Sen and well over 50 Kenki if not capped.  
Idealistically its good to be at 3 sen.
Things also change depending on if you saved Guren from Titan or not, but as you consistently clear Titan you should not have to Guren in Titan.

The ideal 3 sen opener goes as follows, (Fit Seigan where ever works for you. Shinten as much as possible after using Ikishoten):

![Ultima re-opener](/main/assets/samurai_uwu/ultima_reopener.png)

Note that Shifu and Higanbana are not used. There is some math behind this but basically:  
* Midare and Guren are used under Jinpu to get the damage up buff right away
* You may have excess Kenki to use on Shinten which benefits from only Jinpu
* It is possible to do your Kasha combo before using Meikyo but you risk Ultima phasing and the final Midare will miss some raid buffs
* Having a late Shifu makes it so you enter Ultima after Predation with a good 20 seconds left on Shifu allowing you to get Jinpu back right away
* Higanbana will not tick the whole duration making it a DPS loss to use

<h4>Post-predation</h4>
* You can hit positionals until the Radiant Plumes come out
* You will be always at Melee range for this entire mechanic
* Melee range for the double awoken landslide after plumes as close to the corner of the connecting landslides as possible
* You pretty much want to be using True North whenever you need to hit a positional here

<h4> Ultimate Annihilation </h4>
* You cannot Midare on the first plume cause Ultima becomes targetable a bit after the plume appears, delay Midare to the second plume then slidecast to dodge the second plume
* You can Third Eye the Flaming Crush
* You can move for the "Hard Annihilation Mechanic" right after Ifrit dashes and move back in right after seeing the landslides go off
* You can Third Eye the Tank Purge
* Nothing really happens after unless you don't push Suppresion right away, if that happens make sure to use your gap closer to cancel the knockback since you want to save Arms Length for Aetheric Boom

<h4> Suppression - Eruptions </h4>
* You can press Third Eye after the Eruptions drop for a proc to use Seigan on the gaol
* Walk along the edge of the last Eruption to limit distance between you and the gaol

<h4> Suppression - Gaol </h4>
* At least you got the easiest mechanic

<h4> Suppression - Mistral </h4>
* You can press Third Eye as you arrive with the tanks to get a proc to use Seigan on the gaol
* You can Enpi the Gaol once without losing a GCD while moving towards it
* Don't gap close cause theres still Feather Rains

<h4> Suppression - Light Pillar </h4>
* You can press Third Eye as you arrive with the tanks to get a proc to use Seigan on the gaol
* Arc upwards to do the mechanic correctly but you can gap close as soon as you are over half away point the half circle you are supposed to bait the light pillar around

<h4> Post-Suppression </h4>
* You can Third Eye the Flaming Crush
* Use Meditate right after the Feather Rain

<h4>Aetheric Boom</h4>
* Arms Length timing is around 50% of the cast bar
* Depending on your party, you can stand in the middle of the stage slightly to the north-east to still hit Ultima and still be inside your Aetheric Bubble

<h3>Primal Roulettes</h3>
* You don't ever leave the boss at this point, full focus your rotation and do the mechanics
* Every Primal ends with a Raidwide with Third Eye timings as follows:  
Ifrit - 7 Seconds after Afterburner  
Garuda - 6 Seconds after Wicked Wheel  
Titan - 5 Seconds after the last Plume resolves

<h3> Enrage </h3>
Pot, Buff, and Win. If all went well, you don't even need to LB.

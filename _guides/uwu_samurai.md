Low rDPS but still top aDPS
<!--more-->

This is a WIP guide I will update as I progress through UWU.

I am currently on Titan Gaols dealing a consistent 8k aDPS.
This guide is MAINLY meant to teach samurai players how to pad their parse and optimize their uptime.  
I recommend the reader to have a basic idea of how to do this raid before reading on but this guide still goes over EXACTLY what you need to do as a melee player.

<h3> Budget BiS </h3>
The best budget BiS is the 2.00 GCD BiS for this current raid tier. (5.2) If you got BiS for this raid tier, all you need to do is remeld and get the A.Crystarium Body
piece if you don't have it.  
Since Samurai GCD speed is very important dealing with the timeline of the raid. This is the BiS I will be making this guide in. This means my timeline and timings will be
based off the 2.00 SYNC GCD in this raid which is 2.11. If you already have this BiS you can skip to Garuda since I just explain why 2.00 GCD is the preferred BiS.
![The 2.00 GCD Best in Slot for Samurai. Also known as the Fast Sam](/main/assets/sam_uwu_bis.png)
There exists a slightly better 1.92 BiS that requires you to farm Stormblood Dungeons but the quickest and best BiS to get with minimal farm is the current 2.00 GCD BiS. Fast Samurai
in UWU especially with sync is very much better than slow samurai since crits can very much mess you up during some mechanics, namely Garuda Plumes and Ifrit nails... and yes
when I did this fight as slow sam on the 2.14 GCD BiS I have crit my midare on an Ifrit nail which blew up instantly as well as completely nuking the Spiny Plume with Hissastu: Guren.  
So I say your best bet is fast sam with the 2.00 GCD is you are too lazy to farm. It does more DPS overall than slow sam on sync as well. 

<h3> Garuda </h3>
This is probably the easist place to pad.

Depending on how your group does it, move to opposite of the OT to avoid the line attack and dodge the green tornado AoE afterwards. This is during your opener which is
the EXACT same as the level 80 opener but you must save your Hissatsu: Guren here. This is your AoE line attack that does 850 potency with a 120 second cooldown which also costs
50 kenki. You lose your Hissatsu: Senei at level 70 but in both Garuda and Ifrit using Hissatsu: Guren is better so its not really a big deal. 

You will finish your opener and at this time the plumes will spawn and move right as you hit your Gekko. As the plumes move towards the party you will be in your GCD so start
mashing your Fuga right away while moving slightly more behind the party. You will have lots of kenki at this since you saved your Hissatsu: Guren. It will be tempting to use
Shinten but don't. You will hit most or all of the plumes if you moved slightly behind the party and cause Fuga's range is longer than its animation. Now hit your Oka to gain 
your second sen. You may want to move a little further back until you can make sure there are no plumes behind your hitbox. Now hit Kaiten and your Iaijistu button to do Tenka
Goken. During the cast time start mashing Hissatsu: Guren. If all goes right you will straight up nuke all the plumes. Take a look at your parse overlay you should be at around
10-14k dps if you hit all the adds. This next part is dependent on your party. If your party has weaker AoEs the plumes may still be alive with a few HP. In this case, double
weave a Hissatsu: Kyuten (the 25 kenki AoE oGCD that no one uses outside of dungeons) right after the Hissastu: Guren. If your party has good AoEs then most of the plumes will be
dead. Afterwards press your Hakaze on Garuda, switch target to the Spiny plume and press Jinpu. Right as the Jinpu hits, Garuda will screech and go untargetable. Move for the
feather rain. You may need to inform your tank that you will be using a GCD on the spiny since it does do a significant amount of damage.  

Garuda comes back, finish with Gekko to end the combo. Weave third eye after the Gekko for the Mistral Song then move into where ever the bubble was dropped by the Spiny Plume 
and carry on with your rotation. (Hakaze, Yukikaze) but weave your Hissatsu: Seigan somewhere in between. Move out of the bubble when you see the start of the Friction cast and
group with the 3 people assigned to be outside of the bubble. Weave a Bloodbath around this time to help your healers. 

Mechanics wise, move in and out of the bubble on your assigned order. If you are first to enter, move 1 GCD after Friction applies its damage or when you see everyone is around 75% health.
If you are second DPS to enter, watch the first DPS to enter, then move in immediately after you see everyone is 75% health. Our group has one of the healers saying "go" whenever he
has healed everyone up. 

Now in terms of optimizing, you do not need to use True North here since the boss should be facing towards the 5 people inside the bubble, so if you are standing at the side 
waiting to go in, you will be naturally at the flank during your Kasha Combo. You should be entering your filler phase near the end of bubbles. At this current point you are going 
to do your 4 GCD filler but only half of it. (Hakaze, Yukikaze, Hagakure) Now you will 4 GCDs of your rotation as per nowmal; Hakaze, Jinpu, Gekko, Hakaze, and Garuda will 
screech and go untargetable. Dodge the feather rain but press Kaiten while moving back. When Garuda is targetable again, press Higanbana the moment you can. This will be under the Kaiten
you did while Garuda was untargetable. Finish the lingering Hakaze with Yukikaze, Meikyo Shisui, enter your burst phase. After burst you will be doing your Kasha combo. Right when you hit KashA,
Garuda will screech but remain targetable. You may have to strafe hit your Kasha, but just make sure you hit the Kasha but not get hit by the feather rain. Dodge the feather rain and
stick on to Garuda. Hit your Hakaze, Yukikaze combo, position yourself at around half max melee distance while weaving Kaiten. Now press Midare. This is where fast sam pops off.
If you mash your Yaten during the Midare cast you will always backflip out of the wicked wheel safely and directly into the party to stack for the line attack mechanic.

While stacking, just mash your Enpi. It should be around 3 times. Your Jinpu buff will fall off at this time. When Garuda screenches again, press your Gyoten (dash to target) right
when you hear the screech. Immediately hit your Gekko combo to get your Jinpu back and be prepared to make adjustments to avoid the Tornado AoEs and your tank's Feather Rain if
they are too close. 

Plumes will spawn soon. While moving back to the center with the tank you should have around 2 sen (gekko and ka) when you hit your Hakaze the plumes will spawn. Target any plume,
I just press tab, move a little bit back behind the party and press Kaiten and Tenka Goken to hit all plumes and Garuda. Finish your Hakaze on Yukikaze. Use your Hissastu: Kyuten
in-between GCDs while hitting the Fuga, Oka or Fuga, Mangestu combo. Doesn't really matter here so you can just use the one that refreshes a buff of your choice. I usually do Mangetsu
since having Jinpu at a higher number never hurts. You can then use a Kaiten into Tenka Goken here but the adds should be dead afterwards. If not, do an AoE combo again while weaving
Hissastu: Kyuten. Garuda will screech and go untargetable, so dodge the feather rains. All adds should be dead by the time Garuda is targetable again. 

Meikyo Shisui, Ikishoten and Hissastu: Guren will be ready at this point but hold them for Ifrit. You want to skip the tankbusters near the end of Ifrit so you want to output max
damage to Ifrit. Our party pots on our Ifrit re-openers so I always save those 3 abilities for Ifrit. Garuda becomes a training dummy at this point so just do your rotation,
kill Garuda, and go next phase. If you and your party are doing good you will always almost skip the Wicked Wheel which is just a telegraphed point blank and an "get near the boss" mechanic. 

<h3> Transition Phase 1 </h3>
Healer will get the Beyond Limits, so don't accidentally take it. If you have any sen, you want to Hagakure it right away, you want to do a clean re-opener to align with buffs and your pot.
Move to the center of the stage and press the following abilities in order:  
Hagakure -> Sprint -> Meditate

The way I do this mechanic is I rotate my camera around to find Ifrit. Then I move my camera either left or right and look closely. The second I see a small blob of fire appear
the side I am looking at, I 180 my camera and hold W until I am at the safe spot which is opposite of the side I was looking at. If I do not see a blob of fire, I just hold W 
and run into the safe spot that appeared where I was looking at. If you are Dragoon just backflip there, it places you right at the safe spot. Ninjas can also directly TP to the safe spot.

<h3> Ifrit </h3>
